        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I know it's everyone's least favorite part of the recipe.
            Mine too. So I'll just tell you a few tips before cutting to the case.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your eggs before you break them, <em>not before you put them into the fridge</em>. That way they are going to stay <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/podcast/living-the-country-life-radio/should-you-wash-eggs-or-not#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%20is%20%E2%80%9CNo,re%20removing%20that%20natural%20barrier.">fresh longer</a>.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to cook your rice beforehand.</li>
            <li>White-parts are not actually white. They are allowed to be kinda green-ish. So the better name would be a solid part. The hollow part are the ones for decoration.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that recipe is a lie and if I were you I would definitely dabble the amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Leftover rice</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>2 bowls</em></dd>
            <dd>It would be perfect, if it spent a night in the fridge. But if your are not that good with planning - I sure am not - just make sure it's not right from the stove. Give your rice some time to cool down.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Green Onion</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>1 onion</em></dd>
            <dd>But I don't think that they sell it like this, so you would still buy a ~50g pack.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Oil</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>1 tbs</em></dd>
            <dd>Neutral flavor</dd>
            <dt><strong>Eggs</strong></dt>
            <dd>Actually just <em>1 large egg</em></dd>
            <dd>If you are not sure are those large eggs or not, just use two.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Rice vinegar</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>1/2 tbs</em></dd>
            <dd>Don't overdo this one otherwise... Wll, vinegar is not for everyone, right? You don't want you rice to be vinegar flavoured</dd>
            <dt><strong>Spice</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>For your taste</em></dd>
            <dd>Not necessary, but highly recommended</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Beaten The Eggs</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Or the egg. Just make them (it) fluffy</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>(Under)Cook The Eggs</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Stir-fry the eggs (or egg), but don't make an omelette. It still should be a little bit runny.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cut the onions</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Separate the white-parts from the green-parts. It's kinda tricky part, but, if you read a description for you it would be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Stir-fry the onions</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pretty self-explanatory for my taste. But remember we are only frying white-parts!</li>         
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add rice</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Important. We are making a fried rice not a mushed rice. So, yeah, it's a big chunk of rice, but be gentle separating it, okay?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add eggs</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>You will need to cut them into a smaller chunks with a help of a spatula, but be gentle with a rice.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add soy sauce and rice vinegar</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Mix them good, but, yeah, I will say that again, be gentle with a rice.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add green-parts</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Stir-fry them for a little bit more.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Eat</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>No, seriously it's delicious.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
